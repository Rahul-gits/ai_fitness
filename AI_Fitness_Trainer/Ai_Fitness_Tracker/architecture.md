# Architecture

This document contains the detailed system design and technical architecture for the AI Fitness Tracker. It centralizes deep explanations and diagrams so that the README remains clean and high‑level.

## Conceptual Architecture (Simplified)

```mermaid
graph TD;
  USER[Webcam Browser] -->|Local inference| AI[MediaPipe Client];
  AI -->|Reps Angles| FE[React SPA];
  FE -->|REST Auth History| API[FastAPI];
  FE -->|WS Chat Leaderboard| WS[WS Manager];
  API -->|Async ORM| DB[(PostgreSQL)];
  WS -->|PubSub| DB;
```

---

## High‑Level Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD;
  U[User] --> R[React+Tailwind];
  R -->|REST| API[FastAPI];
  R <-->|WS| WS[WebSocket];
  API --> CV[MediaPipe+States];
  API --> RF[RF Model];
  API --> DB[(PostgreSQL)];
  API --> LLM[LLM Coach];
  RF --> API;
  CV --> API;
  LLM --> WS;
```

Components
- React frontend: UI, camera access, and live overlays
- FastAPI backend: APIs, auth, orchestration, and persistence
- MediaPipe: real‑time landmarks in the browser, passed as events
- RF Model: multi‑output regressor for personalization targets
- LLM Coach: context‑aware, formatted coaching outputs
- PostgreSQL: durable storage for users, workouts, and social features

---

## Computer Vision Pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  CAM[Webcam] --> MP[MediaPipe Pose];
  MP --> ANG[Landmarks and Angles];
  ANG --> SM[State Machines];
  SM --> REPS[Reps Timers];
  REPS --> POST[Posture Score];
  POST --> EVT[API Events];
  EVT --> DB[(PostgreSQL)];
```

Details
- Landmark detection: MediaPipe yields stable 2D/3D joint coordinates at real‑time FPS
- State machines: Angle thresholds and phase transitions for dynamic movements and static holds
- Posture scoring: Penalizes joint deviations from expected form windows
- Events: Aggregated metrics are sent to the backend for storage and analytics

---

## ML Personalization Pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  RAW[User+Dataset] --> PRE[Preprocess+Encode];
  PRE --> FE[Feature Eng BMI BMR];
  FE --> TRAIN[RF Regr MultiOutput];
  TRAIN --> SAVE[joblib pipeline];
  SAVE --> SERVE[API personalize];
```

Targets
- calories: BMR driven with activity factor
- water: mass and session duration based
- intensity: experience‑level aware

Notes
- Handles missing values, encodes categoricals, adds engineered features (BMI, BMR)
- Prints MAE and RMSE; persists a joblib pipeline
- Fallback rules used if the model is not available

---

## Chatbot and AI Reasoning Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User
  participant FE as Frontend
  participant API as FastAPI
  participant RF as RF Model
  participant LLM as Coach

  U->>FE: Ask for a plan
  FE->>API: POST /chatbot/ask
  API->>RF: Predict targets
  RF-->>API: Calories Water Intensity
  API->>LLM: Prompt with profile and targets
  LLM-->>API: Formatted plan
  API-->>FE: Render reply
```

Formatting
- Strict sectioned bullets for Workout, Diet, Hydration, Explanation
- Deterministic fallback used when LLM is unavailable

---

## Real‑Time Social and Gamification (WebSockets)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant FE as Frontend
  participant WS as WS Manager
  participant DB as PostgreSQL

  FE->>WS: chat_message {to, text}
  WS->>DB: insert ChatMessage
  WS-->>FE: chat_received {from, text}

  FE->>WS: duel_request {target, exercise}
  WS-->>FE: duel_invite {from, exercise}
  FE->>WS: duel_accept {opponent, exercise}
  WS-->>FE: duel_start {opponent, exercise}
  FE->>WS: duel_progress {reps}
  WS-->>FE: opponent_progress {reps}
  FE->>WS: duel_end {reps}
  WS-->>FE: duel_finished {from, reps}
```

---

## Auth and Security Flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  A[Signup/Login] --> B[JWT Issue];
  B --> C[Protected Endpoints];
  C --> D[DB Access via ORM];
  A --> E[TOTP Setup Optional];
  E --> F[TOTP Verify];
```

---

## Full System Data Flow

```mermaid
graph TD;
  subgraph Frontend
    CAM2[CameraView] --> OVL[Overlay and UI];
    CHAT[Chat UI] --> IO[HTTP WS];
  end
  IO --> API2[FastAPI];
  API2 --> DB2[(PostgreSQL)];
  API2 --> RF2[RF Model];
  API2 --> CVS[CV Services];
  API2 --> COACH[LLM Coach];
  RF2 --> API2;
  CVS --> API2;
  COACH --> IO;
  DB2 --> OVL;
```

## Design Decisions

- MediaPipe vs CNN  
  - Avoids GPU dependency and heavy inference costs  
  - Achieves real‑time performance in the browser

- Random Forest for personalization  
  - Works well with structured features and small data  
  - Minimal tuning and fast inference

- Hybrid approach  
  - CV for signal, state machines for explainable logic  
  - RF for personalization targets, LLM for contextual guidance

---

## Scalability and Performance

- Async FastAPI with efficient I/O boundaries  
- WebSockets for bi‑directional, low‑latency interactions  
- Modular architecture: independent CV, ML, and LLM services  
- Rule‑based fallbacks keep core features online

---

## Future Architecture Improvements

- Multi‑agent coaching roles (form, pacing, motivation, recovery)  
- Reinforcement learning for adaptive program progression  
- Mobile deployment with on‑device lightweight models  
- Federated learning to personalize without centralizing data
